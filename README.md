# obtain_email_addresses_state_legislatures

Creating an easy method to determine state emails

What compelled me to create this?

1.  I had an issue recently  where I desired contacting representatives from multiple states, I soon learned that it is difficult to obtain representatives email addresses.
2.  From experience I can say that most representatives do not respond, or offer a horribly generic response which indicates your email was not read.  Therefore,  if you really wish to be heard, it is clear that you need to speak with a bullhorn: let every representative know your desire.
3.  Online forms often are terrible.  They often force you to categorize your  concern but do not offer an appropriate category (sometimes they  dont even offer the 'other' or 'misc' categories!).  There is really no great way  to know if the email was successful, whereas if you send it yourself you receive a mailer daemon error. Etc.
4.  There has been some talk in the news at different times of politicians using non-government email addresses.  This is important, the '.gov' email address to insure our concerns have documentation that could be made available via FOIA request(from what i understand).
5.  Its 2020: why aren't representative contact methdologies centralized/standardized?

FYI I know the code is bad at the moment.  This is early stages, trying to find common webscraping patterns that can be reused.  Also I need a brushup on  python package structure, but the output of the script(s) is more important to me than form.
